# I2C driver asynchronous - I2C EEPROM

This example application shows how to use the I2C driver in asynchronous mode to perform operations on the EEPROM.

## Description

This example uses the I2C driver in asynchronous mode to communicate with the EEPROM to perform write and read operations in Bare-Metal environment. This application uses I2C driver to read and write data from an AT24CM02 EEPROM device.

## Downloading and building the application

To clone or download this application from Github, go to the [main page of this repository](https://github.com/Microchip-MPLAB-Harmony/core_apps_pic32cxbz6_wbz6) and then click **Clone** button to clone this repository or download as zip file.
This content can also be downloaded using content manager by following these [instructions](https://github.com/Microchip-MPLAB-Harmony/contentmanager/wiki).

Path of the application within the repository is **apps/driver/i2c/async/i2c_eeprom** .

To build the application, refer to the following table and open the project using its IDE.

### Setting up [PIC32CX WBZ653 Curiosity Board](https://www.microchip.com/developmenttools/ProductDetails/)
- To run the demo, the following additional hardware are required:
  - One [EEPROM 3 Click](https://www.mikroe.com/eeprom-3-click) board

- Plug the [EEPROM 3 click Board](https://www.mikroe.com/eeprom-3-click) into the MikroBus socket of the curiosity board
- Connect the Debug USB port on the board to the computer using a micro USB cable


## Running the Application

1. Build and program the application using its IDE
2. LED indicates success or failure:
    - The LED is turned ON when the value read from the EEPROM matched with the written value

Refer below table for LED name
